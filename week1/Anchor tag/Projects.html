        NASA Lâ€™Space Mission Concept Program: Mars Rover Mission Proposal
    </h2>
    <p>
        For this project, my team drafted an 85-page mission proposal for a Mars Rover. I personally led the Business
        subteam and was the software expert. I defined all system software components and created a functional view of
        their interactions for the rover.
