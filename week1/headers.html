    <h1>Chapter: About Albert Einstein</h1>
    <h2>Childhood</h2>
    <h4>Parents</h4>
    <p>
        Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[21] in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879.[22]
        His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews, were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880,
        the family moved to Munich's borough of Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt, where Einstein's father and his uncle
        Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based
        on direct current.[21] He often related a formative event from his youth, when he was sick in bed and his father
        brought him a compass. This sparked his lifelong fascination with electromagnetism. He realized that "Something
        deeply hidden had to be behind things." (from Wikipedia)

    <h4>School</h4>
    Albert attended St. Peter's Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of five. When he was eight, he was
    transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received advanced primary and then secondary school education.(from
    Wikipedia)
    <br><br>
    In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in Munich, but without
    success—they lacked the capital that would have been required to update their technology from direct current to the
    more efficient, alternating current alternative.[25] The failure of their bid forced them to sell their Munich
    factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere. The Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few
    months later to Pavia, where they settled in Palazzo Cornazzani.[26] Einstein, then fifteen, stayed behind in Munich
    in order to finish his schooling. His father wanted him to study electrical engineering, but he was a fractious
    pupil who found the Gymnasium's regimen and teaching methods far from congenial. He later wrote that the school's
    policy of strict rote learning was harmful to creativity. At the end of December 1894, a letter from a doctor
    persuaded the Luitpold's authorities to release him from its care, and he joined his family in Pavia.[27] While in
    Italy as a teenager, he wrote an essay entitled "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic
    Field".(from Wikipedia)

    <h2>Marriages, relationships and children</h2>
    <h4>Mileva Marić</h4>
    <p>
        Correspondence between Einstein and Marić, discovered and published in 1987, revealed that in early 1902, while
        Marić was visiting her parents in Novi Sad, she gave birth to a daughter, Lieserl. When Marić returned to
        Switzerland it was without the child, whose fate is uncertain. A letter of Einstein's that he wrote in September
        1903 suggests that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.
        <br><br>
        Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert was born in Bern, Switzerland.
        Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910. In letters that Einstein wrote to Marie Winteler in the months
        before Eduard's arrival, he described his love for his wife as "misguided" and mourned the "missed life" that he
        imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married Winteler instead: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare
        minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be."(from Wikipedia)
