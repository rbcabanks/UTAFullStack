    <!---paragraph tag--->
    <br>
    <p>During the Cold War, the Soviet Union captures U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers after shooting down his U-2 spy
        plane. Sentenced to 10 years in prison, Powers' only hope is New York lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks),
        recruited by a CIA operative to negotiate his release. Donovan boards a plane to Berlin, hoping to win the young
        man's freedom through a prisoner exchange. If all goes well, the Russians would get Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance),
        the convicted spy who Donovan defended in court.
